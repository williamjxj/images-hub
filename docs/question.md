1. I am implementing an AI-powered chatbox using Next.js, Clerk, shadcn/ui, and Tailwind CSS. For backend AI integration (Deepseek LLM), I'm planning to use the Vercel AI Gateway with my Deepseek API key, offering cloud scalability and ease of deployment, but with possible server costs.
   My vercel-api-key and deepseek-api-key will be in .env.local file.

please implement a basic version. any question you can ask me firstly to clarify then start

2. add Cloudflare R2 images display: need 3 tabs for from 3 buckets

3. gitingest + github repo, gitMCP to extract contexts as cursor's @Docs or rules

4. I want to create a webpage as a hub to search/display images from unsplash, pixabay, pexels using their apis. is it a good idea? recommend/suggest me how to do it?
